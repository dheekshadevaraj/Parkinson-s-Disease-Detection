# ðŸ§  Parkinson's Disease Detection Using Voice Analysis

This project uses machine learning techniques to analyze voice recordings and predict the presence of Parkinson's disease. It demonstrates the use of Random Forest classifiers, parameter tuning, and model evaluation on real-world biomedical data.

##  Project Summary

Parkinsonâ€™s disease is a neurodegenerative disorder that affects motor function, often altering voice patterns. By analyzing voice metrics, we can identify patterns that may indicate the presence of the disease. This project trains and tests machine learning models to detect Parkinsonâ€™s disease from voice recordings.

## ðŸ“Œ Objectives
- Use Python for biomedical data analysis and machine learning
- Implement a Random Forest classifier to detect Parkinsonâ€™s disease
- Tune model hyperparameters using Grid Search
- Visualize and evaluate the performance of classification models
- Interpret decision tree outputs

## Parkinson Data and Voice Disorder

<a href=https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/parkinsons>Voice disorder dataset</a> can be used to detect the presence of Parkinson's disease in an individual. While current tools have limitations in analyzing complex voice disorders, advancements in technology and research have enabled the development of new algorithms that can identify specific acoustic markers associated with Parkinson's disease in voice recordings. Therefore, the analysis of voice disorders can provide valuable information in diagnosing and monitoring Parkinson's disease.
